One-way traffic lanes are RECOMMENDED for use by
all vessels traveling between the points involved.  They have been designated to
aid in the prevention of collisions in the Puget Sound waters, but are
not intended in any way to supersede or alter the applicable Rules of the
Road. Separation zones are intended to separate inbound and outbound traffic
and to be free of ship traffic.  Separation Zones should not be used except
for crossing purposes. When crossing traffic lanes and separation zones, use
extreme caution.
Precautionary Areas have been established where major lanes merge
and cross the traffic separation scheme.  It is recommended that vessels proceed
with caution in these areas.  Wherever practical, vessels entering or leaving the
system should do so at these precautionary areas.  For more information regarding
Traffic Separation Scheme procedures and regulations, see 33 CFR 167 and / or
chapter 2 of the U.S. Coast Pilot.
